From the example:

User *frank = [User alloc];

success = [frank save];
NSLog(@"Frank's save was successful:  %d  and his pk is now %d", success, [frank.pk intValue]);
NSLog(@"There are now %d users", [User count]);

User *jeff = [User alloc];
jeff.username = @"jeff";
jeff.password = @"secret";
NSLog(@"Before saving, Jeff's pk is %d", [jeff.pk intValue]);
success = [jeff save];
NSLog(@"Jeff's save was successful:  %d  and his pk is now %d", success, [jeff.pk intValue]);
NSLog(@"There are now %d users", [User count]);

User *brian = [User alloc];

NSLog(@"Before saving, Brian's pk is %d", [brian.pk intValue]);
success = [brian save];
NSLog(@"Brian's save was successful:  %d  and his pk is now %d", success, [brian.pk intValue]);

NSLog(@"There are %d users with the password 'secret', they are:", [User countWhere:@"password = ?", @"secret"]);
for (User *u in [User findWhere:@"password = ?", @"secret"])
  NSLog(u.username);
  
NSLog(@"User 3 is...");
User *user3 = [User findByPk:[NSNumber numberWithInt:3]];
